==============================
===== Theme
==============================
1. Action/Adventure - This is the most common and straightforward sort of adventure
      there is. In the Action/Adventure scenario, you present your
      characters with a task and then confront them with obstacles to
      overcome in order to accomplish the task successfully.
2. Comedy - This adventure is fun for fun's sake. Its basic purpose is to
      provide humorous entertainment with a minimum of actual danger or
      tragedy.
3. Revenge - In this adventure, some villain has so offended one or more of
      the characters that he cannot be suffered to live.
      (Alternatively, the injured party could hire the characters to
      avenge his honor.) The villain must be found or otherwise gotten
      at, setting up the final duel or showdown between villain and
      characters.
4. Horror - This type of adventure is designed to scare both the characters
      and the players. Just having a monster attack is not enough for a
      horror theme; the monster must first frighten the characters.
5. Espionage - Espionage adventures are active, grim scenarios involving spying
      and perhaps other cloak-and-dagger deeds such as assassination or
      rescue.
6. Mystery - Here, the characters are presented with a mystery -- often a
      murder -- and have to find out who did what to whom.
7. Romance - This sort of adventure (rarely played, but worthwhile anyway) has
      as its central plot the romance between two characters, usually a
      player-character and an NPC.

==============================
===== Goal
==============================
1. Explore a New Area - The heroes are hired or convinced to enter an unmapped area and
      explore it. They may be making a map; they may be trying to find
      someone who disappeared into this area in the past; they may be
      following legends that tell of treasure in the unexplored
      interior.
2. Thwart Monstrous Plan - This is a classic fantasy-adventure plot: The characters learn of
      some horrible plan made by a monstrous enemy, and must thwart it
      before the kingdom is lost or the world is destroyed. This is an
      epic goal, and usually requires that the characters go to all
      sorts of places, rounding up allies and artifacts, before being
      strong enough to face their enemy.
3. Clear Name - The name of one of the characters or an NPC has been sullied and
      the characters must clear it. The characters must find out a) why
      the name has been smeared, b) who is responsible, and c) why the
      responsible party is doing it; then they must find evidence to
      convince everyone they're telling the truth.
4. Gain Money - The heroes are intent on acquiring a fee or treasure. If it's a
      fee, you may wish to roll again on this page to learn the
      patron's goal. If it's a treasure, pay attention to the Settings
      section, which will dictate where the treasure is, if not who
      owns it.
5. Settle a Debt - A player character may find himself in the position of needing to
      settle a debt. He could gamble away all his money and need to
      raise some more to repay the gambling house before its enforcers
      come for him. On a more personal level, the character may need to
      settle a debt of either money or honor that he owes to an NPC.
6. Encounter Old Villain - If your campaign has a villain who shows up again and again to
      bedevil the heroes, then this is an episode featuring that
      villain. You might wish to roll once again on this section to see
      what the villain's goal is.
7. Protect Endangered NPC(s) - One or more NPCs are in danger, and the characters must protect
      them. They might be doing this for a reward, or because one or
      more of the NPCs is a friend or relative of the character. You
      need to decide what the characters are protecting the NPCs from.
      The NPC might be a wealthy or powerful person being sought by
      assassins or kidnappers. The NPC might be a whole village of
      peasants who are being terrorized by a bandit chieftan.
8. Survive Environment - The characters could end up in a hostile environment which they
      must cross -- a desert, a jungle, or other hostile setting. In
      the course of the adventure they'll need to find food and water,
      resist the elements, and perhaps fight off attacks of the
      natives.
9. Retrieve Item - This goal is like the Rescue, except the victim is an inanimate
      object. This item may be an artifact, a paper containing evidence
      against a character or patron, an antidote needed to save another
      NPC or palyer character, or just some item of sentimental value
      -- an item which one NPC hires the characters to steal from
      another NPC.
10. Gain Power - The heroes are on this adventure to gain personal or political
      power for themselves. They may be looking for an artifact or
      weapon, or are performing a mission for someone who will reward
      them with political power (a higher social rank or lands, for
      instance). If the characters are doing someone else's bidding,
      you might want to roll again on this section to see what goal the
      patron will have assigned to the characters.
11. Rescue NPC(s) - The characters must rescue one or more kidnapped NPCs, probably
      from the stronghold of the kidnapper. Obviously, they must get to
      said stronghold, break in, rescue the kidnappee, break out, and
      escape back to safety; this usually requires careful and clever
      planning and a large dose of luck.
12. Win War - In this adventure or set of adventures, the characters become
      part of an army -- a force assaulting another kingdom, perhaps,
      or an army defending one realm from another.
13. Escape - Early in the adventure, the heroes are captured. The remainder of
      the adventure consists of them learning enough so that they can
      escape. They have to get to know their fellow prisoners, learn
      the prison's routine, inventory their possessions, acquire other
      possessions they need, plan an escape, and execute it.

==============================
===== Story Hook
==============================
1. Old Enemy - This is a straightforward story hook; the hero learns that his
      oldest enemy is back and is very active in the campaign, up to
      something. The hero will naturally want to investigate and will
      walk right into the story.
2. Dying Delivery - On some occassion when the hero is out wandering the streets or
      is otherwise all alone, a dying man bumbs into him, hands him
      something, says a few words, and dies.
3. Old Friend - Another classic story hook is the Old Friend, the childhood
      friend of our hero, who shows up in one of several ways to drag
      the hero into the story.
4. Hero Offended - Someone greatly offends the hero, so much so that he'll pursue
      his offender right into the adventure. (Note that this usually
      means that the offender is a minion of the Master Villain. You'll
      have to decide whether the minion offended the hero precisely to
      bring him into the adventure or just as a side-effect of his
      ordinary villain activities.)
5. Not in Kansas - The PCs are minding their own business and find themselves
      transported to a strange place.  They must figure out where they
      are, why they are there, and how to escape.
6. Legend and Rumor - In this classic story hook, the hero stumbles across some new or
      long-forgotten knowledge that promises great treasure or gain.
7. Mystery Woman - Create an NPC "mystery woman" sure to be fascinating to your hero
      and have her keep appearing inexplicably in his life. As he
      becomes interested and investigates her, he keeps stumbling
      across the villain's plans and becomes inextricably mired in the
      plot. (For female player-characters, the Mystery Man is just as
      useful.)
8. Missing Memories - One or more of the PCs wakes up with no memory of the recent
      past, and now they find themselves in some kind of trouble they
      don't understand.  The PCs must find the reason for the memory
      lapse, and solve any problems they uncover in the meantime.
9. Pressing Buttons - As a general story-hook approach, think about the
      player-character -- his personal goals and his personal dislikes.
      If the hero is pursuing a specific goal, you have one of the
      minor villains, as a side-effect of the villain's master plan,
      thwart the hero's latest step towards that goal. Alternatively,
      if there's something the hero truly hates to see, have it happen
      -- and have the villains be responsible.
10. Better Late than Never - Some bad guys have arrived and done some bad guy things.  The PCs
      were none the wiser.  The bad guys have now made good their
      escape, and the PCs have caught wind of it in time to chase them
      down before they make it back to their lair, their home nation,
      behind enemy lines, etc.
11. Grim Necessity - If the hero doesn't involve himself with this adventure, he's
      going to find himself suffering or dead -- period. That's the
      hook to bring him into the adventure... but you have to determine
      why he'll suffer or die if he doesn't become involved.
12. Mistaken Identity - The hero could be mistaken by one villain for another villain
      involved in the master plot. This has good comic potential if the
      hero and missing villain are in fact so similar that no one can
      tell them apart. (This is even more fun if they turn out to be
      long-lost twins.)

==============================
===== Plot
==============================
1. Accumulation of Elements - In this sort of plot, the heroes have to go from place to place
      -- perhaps covering very little area like a city, perhaps roaming
      the known world -- and accumulate elements to be used against the
      Master Villain. These elements may be clues, pieces of an
      artifact, evidence, or allies.
2. Geographic Progression - This is the simplest sort of adventure plot. The heroes have an
      area to investigate or travel through; they have encounters based
      on where they are. For instance, the traditional dungeon, where
      monsters are tied to specific rooms or areas. Or, if the heroes
      are travelling along a narrow valley or through an enchanted
      forest, they might suffer ambushes and other encounters fixed to
      various points along their travel plan. The plot, then, is
      getting to the villain by surviving the intervening obstacle
      encounters.
3. Event - For this plot, choose some sort of event -- a tournament, a
      holiday, a celebration called by the king, a masked ball, or
      whatever -- and set the commencement of the Master Villain's plan
      against that backdrop.
4. A-B-C Quest - This is an epic sort of plot. In it, the heros are given (or
      undertake) a task to perform: The taking of a city, the rescue of
      an innocent, the destruction of a monster, the creation of a
      magical item, the defeat of a Master Villain, etc. But the path
      to victory is not a simple one. To get to their goal, Event A,
      they find that they must first accomplish some other task --
      Event B. But when they undertake the task of accomplishing Event
      B, they find that they must first accomplish Event C. This goes
      on for several encounters, until the heroes accomplish all the
      obstacle events which prevent them from returning to Event A,
      their original goal.
5. Series of Villains - This is a very dramatic plot, and very well-suited to oriental
      campaigns. In it, the heroes have undertaken a quest, usually the
      finding and defeat of the Master Villain. They may have to travel
      to his citadel, or head off in another direction to find some
      artifact capable of defeating him, or run away from pursuing
      villains until they can figure out what's going on. All along
      their route, they are set upon by villains -- each villain has a
      name and distinct personality, and each encounter is
      life-or-death for the heroes and villains; the villain never
      escapes to safety if the tide turns against him, he fights unto
      death.

==============================
===== Climax
==============================
1. Bloody Battle - This is the best Climax for an adventure involving the clash of
      mighty armies -- or for any adventure where, toward the end, the
      Master Villain and a large body of minions confront the heroes
      and their own troops. This finale is characterized by a monstrous
      clash between the two forces, with the heroes chewing through the
      enemy ranks to get at the Master Villain and his elite guards.
      It's strenuous, exciting, and classically simple.
2. Scattered Duels - In this climax, the heroes have gotten to the end of their quest
      -- they may have broken into, sneaked into, or escaped from
      imprisonment within the villain's citadel, or have marched into
      the little town where the villain is holed up -- and they become
      separated. You can separate them by having traps and tricks break
      the party apart, by having them see two or three things they must
      resolve (such as danger to innocents or the appearance of minion
      villains) pop up simultaneously; they'll have to run in all
      directions at the same time or suffer failure. Once the party is
      broken down into bite-sized chunks, you confront each individual
      or small group with the enemy or enemies he most deserves to face
      -- his personal enemy, the monster which defeated him before,
      etc. -- for a grand series of climactic duels.
3. Throne Room Duel - This is set up much like the Scattered Duels, except that you
      don't separate the heroes. It's harder to control whom fights who
      in this situation... but if it doesn't matter who has the final
      duel with the Master Villain, this is a classic climax choice.
4. Chase to Ground - First, you have the Heroes Chasing the Villain. The villain,
      after a series of encounters with the heroes, is running to
      safety, to some place where he can acquire more power, or to
      somehwere he can accomplish some dread purpose such as
      assassination or mass murder. The heroes chase him, have to deal
      with the obstacles he leaves behind, and finally catch up to him
      before or just as he reaches his goal. Here, we have the final
      duel between the villains forces and the heroes. Second, you have
      the Villain Chasing the Heroes. Often, in a story like this, the
      heroes have found out how to defeat the villain -- such as
      getting to a particular temple and conducting a particular
      ritual. The villain chases them all through their quest, catching
      up to them just as they're commenciing their ritual; they must,
      with heroic effort, conclude the ritual while suffering his
      attacks. Third, you have the Master Villain's Sudden Escape
      Attempt. This takes place in adventures where the Master
      Villain's identity is unknown until the end. His identity is
      revealed and he makes a sudden bolt for freedom; the heroes give
      chase. This usually results in a dangerous foot-chase through
      nasty terrain -- such as across rooftops, through the dungeons,
      or across an active battlefield.
5. Divine Retribution - Here, the heroes' goal has been to alert the gods that the Master
      Villain threatens them or their plans; in the last scenes of the
      adventure, as our heroes face an overwhelming enemy force, the
      gods bring down their divine retribution on the villain, causing
      a massive earthquake, tidal wave, lightning storm, or flood of
      monsters. This is all well and good, but the heroes are too close
      and must escape the fringe effects of this awesome disaster. A
      variant on this is the Natural Disaster. No gods are actually
      involved, but the Master Villain has been tampering with the
      delicate forces of nature. He may, for instance, have been
      powering his master spell with the energies of a volcano. When
      the heroes attack the scene of his spellcasting, the spell goes
      out of control and so does the volcano. The villain is consumed
      in the eruption and the heroes must escape or be consumed
      themselves.
6. Prevented Deed - Here, the heroes have been defeated -- captured by the Master
      Villain, or so thoroughly cut up by his minions that all believe
      them to be dead. And the heroes have learned, from the bragging
      of the villain, loose talk of his minions, or examination of
      clues, what is the crucial event of his master plan. In any case,
      the battered and bruised heroes must race to this site and have
      their final confrontation with the villain, bursting in on him
      and his minions just as the knife or final word or key is poised,
      and prevent the awful deed from taking place -- and,
      incidentally, defeat the master villain and minions who beat them
      previously.

==============================
===== General Setting
==============================
1. Exotic Distant Land - The adventure will take the heroes to some fascinating and exotic
      distant country, where they'll have to cope with new customs,
      monsters unfamiliar to them, and very colorful NPC encounters;
      choose one of the more fascinating foreign lands from your
      campaign world.
2. Hero's Home Town - The action takes the heroes back to the home territory of one of
      them. Note that this usually means that this hero's family or old
      friends are deeply involved in the adventure.
3. Alternate Plane - Most of the story takes place in an alternate dimension; this
      implies that either the PCs or the villains, or both, have magic
      powerful enough to bridge the dimensional barrier, or that the
      PCs stumble across some dimensional portal.
4. On the Road - Most of the adventure takes place on the road, as the heroes are
      travelling from place to place. This is especially good for
      adventures where heroes are investigating a wide-ranging mystery,
      are part of a caravan, or are being pursued by loathesome
      villains.
5. On the Sea - Most of the action occurs on the sea -- the heroes are shipborne
      for some reason, docking in lots of ports. Again, this is good
      for adventures where the heroes are investigating clues left all
      over the map, are part of some trading enterprise, or are being
      pursued by villains.
6. Torturous Terrain - The adventure takes place in some sort of unsettled, uncivilized,
      dangerous terrain; in action stories, the desert and jungle work
      best; choose one of those two or decide on a setting that is
      similarly dangerous and exotic.
7. Under the Ground - In this variety of adventure, the heroes descend into vast cavern
      networks beneath the earth's crust. There, they can encounter
      bizarre races and primitive tribes, hitherto-unknown monsters and
      strange landscapes.
8. Under the Sea - This sort of high-fantasy adventure takes place in and under (not
      on top of) the sea. The heroes require access to some sort of
      magic item or spell that allows them to breathe water for long
      stretches, and might adventure in the uncharted depths or perhaps
      in a community of sea-breathers.
9. Cosmopolitan City - Most of the story takes place in a large, sophisticated city;
      center the villain's plot and activities around that city. This
      setting is best suited to adventures involving more people than
      monsters; most of your villains should be human or demi-human.

==============================
===== Specific Setting I
==============================
1. Tavern/Inn - This is a classic fantasy setting, the residence of travelling
      heroes and the home of the tavern brawl.
2. Craftsman's Quarter - This can occur in either the shop of the master craftsman of a
      palace or manor, or the guild-area of a city.
3. Mansion of a Lord - This can be the home of a villain -- the characters may have to
      break in and rescue someone or steal evidence, or break out if
      they've been captured -- or of a heroic ally, in which case it
      may be used as the headquarters for the heroes' plans and
      activities.
4. Shacktown of the Oppressed - Part of the action centers around the tenements or shacks of the
      worst part of town; perhaps an allied NPC lives here or the
      characters are fugitives hiding out in the nasty part of town.
5. Caves of Magical Folk - These can be either beautiful, glittering homes of gorgeous
      magical peoples, or the dank and terrifying lairs of horrible
      monsters.
6. Demi-human Community - In wilderness areas, this will be a large community of
      demi-humans -- elves, dwarves, halflings, whatever -- or
      intelligent nonhumans such as orcs. If your action is taking
      place in a city, this could be a hidden community (such as a
      secret underground dwarf community) or a section of the city
      inhabited mostly by demi-humans.
7. Classic Dungeon - This would be the standard monster-filled labyrinth; perhaps it's
      a nesting ground for the master villain's monster troops.
8. Palace of the King - The heroes could be here for many, many different reasons: Trying
      to get a favor from the ruler, part of some nobleman's retinue,
      members of the palace guard, sneaking in to save the ruler from
      assassins, sneaking in to assassinate the ruler, thrown into the
      dungeon for crimes they did or didn't commit, etc.
9. Temple/Church - This can be either the church of some lofty and good diety, or
      the dark and grisly temple of some horrid deity (doubtless filled
      with evil soldiers and monsters), or even the temple that the
      madman villain has dedicated to himself for when he becomes a
      god.
10. Catacombs - These can be catacombs beneath a living city or a ruined one;
      they can be long-forgotten or still in use.
11. Legendary Forest - This classic adventure site is the sometimes dark and fearsom,
      sometimes light and cheerful, always magical and incomprehensible
      forest inhabited by the oldest elven trives and most terrifying
      monsters.
12. Military Encampment - This is best used in an episode involving warfare; it could be
      the good-guy army's encampment, from which the heroes launch
      their adventures, or the villains' encampment, in which case the
      heroes might have to sneak in on a mission or escape from it if
      they're captured.
13. Lost City - This is the remnant of some lost civilization or expedition,
      still thriving in some forgotten corner of the world. Remnants of
      lost civilizations can even inhabit cavern systems beneath
      campaign cities, preying on the above-worlders for their goods,
      slaves, and sacrifices.
14. Madman's Fortress - This is the citadel of a major enemy: Strong, unassailable,
      filled with soldiers and monsters, lined with secret passages and
      deathtraps; not a wholesome place for adventurers to spend their
      time.
15. Ruins - These can be the ruins of some ancient civilization, an
      abandoned temple or castle, incomprehensible blocks of stone
      arranged by ancient gods, etc. They can be magical or normal,
      inhabited by normal animals or by monsters, centers of magic or
      just tumbled-down buildings.
16. Laboratory - This can be alchemical lab of a friendly wizard, or the horrible
      experimental chamber of the villain where new monsters are
      created and relased upon the world.
17. Magical Lake - This is the acquatic equivalent of the Legendary Forest, here
      beautiful and glistening, there treacherous and dangerous, filled
      with water-breathing magical folk.

      with water-breathing magical folk.

==============================
===== Master Villain
==============================
1. Organizer - This Master Villain is the head of the local criminal syndicate
      -- the Thieve's Guild or slaver ring, for instance. He's
      cold-hearted and unsympathetic, and human life means nothing to
      him. He employs assassins and musclemen against the heroes, and
      can only be reasoned with when it's going to profit him more to
      cooperate with the heroes than kill them.
2. Conqueror - This character is moving his army in to take over; that's what he
      lives for. He's been the enemy of your characters' nation's
      ruler, and has launched a full-scale invasion of your characters'
      favorite nation. The heroes have to beat their way through or
      elude his hordes of soldiers in order to get at him; better yet,
      they might lead their own nation's troops against his and
      outthink him in military fashion.
3. God of Chance - Here you have two options. This Master Villain could be a real
      entity -- an actual god of mischief or silliness, who has
      intruded in the heroes' lives to cause chaos and have fun.
      Alternatively, this "villain" could actually be pure chance: The
      heroes are having a series of unrelated, accidental encounters
      which cause them fits. No real single villain is involved,
      although initially it looks as though there is.
4. Zealot - This villain is like the Conqueror, but he's not trying to
      conquer to own; he's trying to purge the world of something he
      feels is pure evil (another religion, a human, demi-human, or
      nonhuman race of sentient beings, a custom). He operates just
      like the Conqueror, enslaving or killing all those who belong to
      the "wrong" race or philosophy.
5. Ravager - This Master Villain is like the Destroyer, except that he
      terrorizes a very limited area -- such as a village, island,
      castle, or clan stronghold. (He may want to destroy the whole
      world but be trapped where he is; perhaps his efforts to free
      himself constitute the adventure's plot.) He stays in his area
      and terrorizes whatever comes into it.
6. Avenger - This villain seeks to avenge some wrong he thinks he's suffered.
      He may be right; he may have suffered a wrong, and this makes him
      a little more sympathetic than villains who are purely evil. The
      Avenger uses his organization -- thugs and bribed officials -- to
      get at the one who wronged him, and will want either to duel
      (singly) the one who wronged him, or to put the wrongdoer in a
      deathtrap.
7. Advance Agent - This villain is the vanguard of some sort of invastion; often, he
      is trying to open up a portal to a dimension full of trapped
      demons and evil gods.
8. Corruptor - The Corruptor is the villain who wants to make something nasty
      out of something that is currently nice. He may be working on a
      small scale -- i.e., wish to corrupt one character or a few
      characters, particularly PCs and their favorite NPCs.
      Alternatively, he may be a big-scale villain trying to change an
      entire city or nation into a jaded, debased pit of sin, hatred
      and death.
9. Destroyer - This villain is like the Corruptor, except that he likes
      destroying instead of corrupting. He operates like the Conqueror,
      moving in his armies -- often nonhuman or monstrous armies -- and
      destroying everything in sight. Again, the Destroyer could easily
      be an evil god or demon, meaning the heroes wil have to find his
      weakness in order to thwart his current plan.
10. Agent Provocateur - This Master Villain is a clever spy who inflitrates an
      organization, order, or army, and tries to effect its destruction
      by getting it to perform actions which will cause others to
      oppose it directly. The identity of this Master Villain is
      usually a closely-guarded secret; the heroes will encounter his
      cover identity, but will not suspect that he's responsible for
      all this chaos until they start adding up clues. Females in this
      role can be very, very effective.
11. Lovable Rogue - This Master Villain isn't really evil -- he's just chaotic and
      fun. Cheerful bandits in the forest who rob from the rich and
      give to the poor, singing and rope-swinging pirate kings, and
      romantic, sophisticated duellists all belong to the category of
      the Lovable Rogue. Often, the Rogue will not be behind the
      nastiness the heroes are encountering; he may be in competition
      with them for the prize they're seeking. Often the heroes and the
      Rogue (and his minions) will have to team up to succeed at their
      task. Just as often, the Rogue will try to get away with the
      whole treasure.
12. Sufferer - This Master Villain disguises himself as some other sort of
      villain. Long ago, he was given an ugly curse -- he longs for
      death but can never die unless slain by heroes unaware of his
      curse. (Naturally, the way the curse works, he has to defend
      himself when attacked by the heroes.) So this villain works hard
      to make sure the best heroes in the world have sufficient cause
      to want to come and kill him. He'll insult them, ruin them,
      kidnap or murder their loved ones, whatever it takes to bring
      them against him. Often, he can only die -- his curse can only be
      undone -- in one specific holy place, so he'll have to lure the
      heroes to that place to face him. If the heroes are doing
      research on the villain all this time, they may find out his
      secret, leading to a sad and painful end to the episode as the
      unkillable villain has to leave and find someone new to kill him.

==============================
===== Minor Villain I
==============================
1. Coward - This character is an ordinary grunt minion of the Master Villain,
      but he's a coward. He's deathly afraid of the Villain and the
      heroes. He's best used when you plan to have the heroes captured;
      by his mannerisms, you can make it clear to them that this fellow
      is a coward and they will begin to work on him psychologically.
2. Mistress with a Heart of Gold - This character is much like the "Lover or Daughter of Villain"
      type of Mystery Woman from the Story Hooks section. In this case,
      she usually accompanies the Master Villain, but sometimes goes on
      missions of her own, where she runs into and develops affection
      for one of the player-characters.
3. Hard-Eyed Advisor - This is the sort of villain whom the heroes see in the Master
      Villain's throne room. He's hard-eyed and scary; life means
      nothing to him and he enjoys killing. He's also a good advisor to
      his master.
4. Childhood Friend with a Dark Secret - This Minor Villain is like the character of the same name from
      the Allies and Neutrals section. However, the heroes find out
      early on that he's really working for the Master Villain. He may
      not wish to be helping the villains; his family may be held
      hostage, or he may just be too frightened of the villain or
      otherwise weak-willed to refuse. Alternatively, he could actually
      be evil now.
5. Chief Assassin - The Chief Assassin is the favorite killer of the Master Villain.
      The Assassin works mostly in the field, first killing witnesses
      who might prove harmful to his master, then zeroing in on the
      player-characters. He usually meets his end before the
      adventure's climax, but he may taken one of the heroes down with
      him.
6. Single-Minded Soldier - This most trustworthy of villain minions is the experienced,
      competent, persistent soldier -- a field-trained officer who
      serves the villain with military precision. He is usually
      encountered in the field as leader of the villain's field
      operations. He is not encountered directly until the middle of or
      the latter part of the adventure; until then, the heroes
      encounter only his subordinates.
7. Lovable Rogue - This character is like the Master Villain of the same name,
      except that he has no minions of his own and serves at someone
      else's bidding. However, he's very independent, not always
      working in his employer's best interests; he often makes fun of
      the Master Villain's pretensions and may suffer that villain's
      retaliation because of it.
8. Misguided Moralist - This fellow has been convinced that only by helping the villain
      achieve the Master Plan can he improve the world. He tends to be
      encountered all through the adventure's plot, usually escaping
      from the heroes and taunting them for their wrong thinking.
      Fortunately, he's no more effective as a villain than he is as a
      thinker.
9. Inquisitor - This villain is the one who interrogates the heroes and NPCs
      captured by the villains. He accompanies the other Minor Villain
      out into the field and works on anyone captured; he enjoys
      inflicting pain and suffering.
10. Corrupted Hero - This villain was once a hero, possibly one known to the players.
      He was seduced by the dark side of the dungeon master. Because of
      his own weakness, or of a curse, he has become a villain, a pawn
      of the Master Villain.
11. Moronic Muscleman - This fellow is a huge, powerful monster of a fighter. His job is
      to smash anything the villain tells him to smash. He does that
      very well, but don't ask him to do any thinking; he has no time
      for such brainy stuff.
12. Snivelling Vizier - The Vizier is a throne-room villain. Functionally, he's rather
      like the Hard-Eyed Advisor, offering tactics and advice to his
      master; but he's an ooily, sleazy, cowardly sycophant. He's
      usually brilliant in his field of advice but has no combat
      abilities.
13. Avenger - This character is much like the Master Villain of the same name,
      but he's not in charge of all this villainy, and he's definitely
      an enemy of one of the player-characters. You'll have to decide
      who he is and why he hates one of the heroes; he could be
      anything from a recurring villain to someone who simply lost a
      fight to the hero once.

==============================
===== Minor Villain II
==============================
1. Single-Minded Soldier - This most trustworthy of villain minions is the experienced,

      serves the villain with military precision. He is usually

10. Childhood Friend with a Dark Secret - This Minor Villain is like the character of the same name from
      the Allies and Neutrals section. However, the heroes find out
      early on that he's really working for the Master Villain. He may
      not wish to be helping the villains; his family may be held
      hostage, or he may just be too frightened of the villain or
      otherwise weak-willed to refuse. Alternatively, he could actually
      be evil now.
11. Inquisitor - This villain is the one who interrogates the heroes and NPCs
      captured by the villains. He accompanies the other Minor Villain
      out into the field and works on anyone captured; he enjoys
      inflicting pain and suffering.
12. Coward - This character is an ordinary grunt minion of the Master Villain,
      but he's a coward. He's deathly afraid of the Villain and the
      heroes. He's best used when you plan to have the heroes captured;
      by his mannerisms, you can make it clear to them that this fellow
      is a coward and they will begin to work on him psychologically.

      like the Hard-Eyed Advisor, offering tactics and advice to his
      master; but he's an ooily, sleazy, cowardly sycophant. He's
      usually brilliant in his field of advice but has no combat
      abilities.

==============================
===== Ally/Neutral
==============================
1. Government Observer - For some reason, the heroes' ruler wants one of his own people
      accompanying them. Whatever the reason, the heroes are now stuck
      with a haughty, self-important royal observer, an expert in
      (probably) military tactics or espionage. He continually offers
      unwanted advice and tends to get the heroes into trouble by
      pulling rank whenever he's not satisfied.
2. Villain Ally - For some reason, the heroes find themselves in the company of a
      villain. Perhaps he's a minion of this adventure's master
      villain; he may be guiding the heroes to wherever they must leave
      a ransom, or, if the master villain is forcing the heroes to
      perform some mission, this villain ally is along to make sure
      they do it right. Whatever the reason, he's competent,
      unpredictable, and out for himself.
3. Grumpy Old Professional - Again, the heroes need an expert in a certain field -- this time
      a craft or art, such as blacksmithing, engineering,
      horse-training, or whatever. The only or best professional they
      can find is an aged expert. He's grumpy, cranky, and
      sharp-tongued; he constantly complains about the food, the
      weather, his companions, the decline in skill of his co-workers
      since he was a young man, the road conditions, the rotten pay
      he's receiving, and so on.
4. Merry Minstrel - This character follows the heroes in order that he might find
      inspiration for his song and storytelling. He can't be shut up;
      he sings all the day long and into the night, is a showoff before
      crowds, and is far too noisy for a party trying to remain
      unobserved.
5. Ingenue in Distress - The heroes must protect some defenseless young innocent who is in
      danger from the villains. This person, perhaps the sheltered son
      or daughter of a nobleman or merchant, has no abilities at all
      but is sweet, charming, and in great need of help.
6. Inquisitive Chronicler - This character is a historian who wishes to accompany the heroes
      to record their exploits. He constantly pries into the heroes'
      backgrounds, asking questions that are none of his business, as
      the adventure continues.
7. Romantic Loony - Somewhere, the heroes bump into a lunatic who falls immediately
      in love with a player-character and won't leave him or her alone.
      This character may be a love-smitten village lass or nebbishy
      adventurer. Whatever the origin, this character must be
      hopelessly in love with the character but have some trait which
      keeps the character from reciprocating; perhaps the loony is too
      plain, too crazed, or too stupid. Whatever, he or she really is
      sincere in his affection for the character.
8. Childhood Friend with a Dark Secret - One of the heroes is accompanied by one of his childhood
      friends... but said friend now has a Dark Secret. He does strange
      and mysterious things (sneaks off to send messages, or behaves
      strangely around certain NPCs, or is scared to death of certain
      harmless animals or situations) and will not explain why to his
      PC friend until late in the story.
9. Arrogant Snob - For some reason, the heroes have to accompany or escort an
      arrogant nobleman or craftsmaster. They can't afford to abandon
      or kill this person; he or she may be their employer, an expert
      on the place they're going to, one of their relatives, or a
      relative of the royal family. And this person makes their life
      hell with sniping comments, haughtiness, and other unbearable
      traits.
10. Hero Worshipper - Some youth -- an urchin, a brother or sister of one of the
      heroes, or a child run away from home -- hooks up with the
      heroes, following them wherever they go, being admiring, talking
      to everyone (neutrals and villains included) about how wonderful
      and powerful the heroes are.
11. Absent-Minded Expert - The characters find they need an expert in some fields --
      pottery, alchemy, whatever -- but all they can find is a somewhat
      daffy and absent-minded master of that subject. He's useful when
      around his subject matter, but otherwise absent-minded,
      incautions, in frequent need of rescuing, etc.
12. Gibbering Madman - Some poor wretch blundered into part of the master villain's plan
      and saw too much. What he saw drove him crazy. He gibber and
      jabbers, occassionally uttering clues about what he's seen, but
      just isn't coherent. He knows enough that the heroes will need to
      take him along to comment on what they're encountering, though,
      so he can't just be met and forgotten.
13. Tragic Fellow Hero - The heroes are in the company of some hero well-known to them; he
      may have been a companion or ally, or they may just know him by
      reputation. He is a tragic figure; he may have lost his family to
      the master villain, or lost his properties and titles, or be
      afflicted with a curse he cannot be rid of, or be committed to a
      quest he knows will take his life. He's dour, and gloomy,
      prophesying doom and having no fun at all.
14. Congenial Madman - This fellow is a pleasant, happy lunatic whom the heroes
      encounter; after the initial encounter, he follows them wherever
      they go, commenting on their plans, behaving strangely, getting
      underfoot, and -- very occassionally -- proving to be a real
      help.
15. Talkative Barkeep - This classic encounter is the garrulous innkeeper who has
      information the characters want; trouble is, they'll have to
      bribe him to get it, or agree to stay at his inn, or buy a lavish
      meal, or listen to his incessant stories about his career in the
      army, or whatever.
16. Obsequious Merchant - This fellow is the owner of the caravan the heroes are
      protecting, or the merchant the heroes encounter when they
      desperately need to buy something. He is oily, ever-flattering,
      overly agreeable, and is a sharp bargainer; the heroes will not
      find him willing to give them a sale price.

==============================
===== Monster Encounter
==============================
1. Ravager - This is another classic monster encounter; the monster which is
      bedeviling a community or local area and will continue to do so
      unless the heroes destroy or defeat it. Yes, this is similar to
      the Master Villain of the same name, but the Ravager usually has
      no master plan -- it just wants to kill, destroy, or eat.
2. Terrain Monster - Don't forget the simple run-in with the animal belonging to the
      terrain where the heroes are: Every type of wilderness has its
      predators and big, nasty herbivores.
3. Reconaissance Monster - At some point in the adventure, the Master Villain will become
      aware of the heroes' activities against him. If he has magical
      abilities or a magical servant, he will send some sort of quiet,
      clever monster to spy on the heroes. The heroes should have an
      opportunity to realize they're being spied upon, leading them to
      a mad scrable as they try to capture or destroy the spy.
4. King Beast - At some point in their adventure, the heroes run across a King
      Beast -- some enormous, intelligent monster (which speaks the
      Common tongue) which is the leader of its species. Perhaps it
      needs help; if the heroes help it they'll earn themselves a favor
      which the King Beast will repay at some later time in the
      adventure. Perhaps the heroes are in deadly danger and need help;
      the King Beast can be persuaded to help, but only in return for a
      deed or favor in the future.
5. Loving Deceiver - One of the player-characters, specifically one of the
      better-looking ones, attracts the attentions of a very attractive
      local of the opposite sex. This local person, encountered in
      unthreatening surroundings, invites the hero off to a liason away
      from his friends and other people. Of course, this person is a
      human-appearing monster of some sort; once alone with the
      character, he/she will attack the character with monstrous
      intent.
6. Nocturnal Predator - This is a classic monster encounter; the arrival of a hungry
      carnivore in the middle of the night. Usually, this attack
      happens to heroes camping between villages or out in the deep
      wilderness; a wild animal, attracted by food odors (from the
      heroes' campfire or from the heroes themselves) sneaks in for a
      bite.
7. Foreshadowing Monster - With this monster encounter, combat may not be necessary. This
      monster encounter exists to alert the characters to the fact that
      something unusual is going on, a foreshadowing of their upcoming
      conflicts with the Master Villain.
8. Beast Amok - Some time when the heroes are in a village or city, an animal,
      probably an otherwise tame or captured beast, is set loose by the
      villain's minions or driven mad by the Master Villain. The beast
      goes berserk in the crowds; if the heroes aren't inclined to
      capture or kill it, it goes after them.
9. Stampede - Should the heroes ever cross plains or prairies, their villainous
      enemies may wish to stampede a herd of large animals at them.
      Alternatively, beasts in the forest may be stampeded by fires set
      by the villains; in this case, it will not be one sort of animal
      charging through, but a mixture of terrified forest animals, from
      the smallest fox-cub to the largest bear.
10. Noble Beast - With this encounter, the heroes find that they have to capture --
      but not injure -- some sort of powerful, noble beast in order to
      accomplish their mission. For instance, to reach a mountain-top
      aerie, they must capture pegasi and ride them up to their enemy.
11. Assassin Monster - This mosnter, at some time in the adventure, is sent by the
      Master Villain to attack one or more heroes when they're at their
      most vulnerable -- asleep, enjoying themselves, etc. Usually, the
      Assassin Monster attacks, but the hero, though injured, is able
      to hold it off long enough for his friends to respond to his
      shouts. The Assassin Monster is usually killed by his friends,
      who can then speculate on who sent it and why.
12. Powerful Tester - Here, some powerful, intelligent monster with shapechanging
      ability turns into a human form. When the heroes encounter him,
      he is in need of help or having trouble. He also obviously can't
      reward the heroes for their help, and will only serve to slow the
      heroes down from their quest. If the heroes help him anyway, the
      Powerful Tester reveals himself in his true form and offers to
      aid the heroes in their quest.

==============================
===== Character Encounter
==============================
1. Blackmailer - If the party is pulling a scam, this person knows it and can tell
      the potential victim; if they're wanted by the authorities, he's
      willing to alert the authorities that they're here; if they're
      hiding out from the Master Villain, he's going to tell said
      villain that they're here; he may have kidnapped one of their
      favorite NPCs and be holding him for ransom; and so on.
2. Belligerent Soldier - The billigerent one has just had his ears pinned back by his
      commanding officer and is anxious to take it out on some hapless
      civilian. If this is a city gate, he claims that the hero's
      papers are wrong or that he recognizes the hero from descriptions
      of a wanted criminal; if this is the streets, he insults the
      hero's lack of military bearing, pretty looks, clothes, smell,
      companion, or whatever it takes to provoke a reaction.
3. Old Friend at the Wrong Time - When the heroes are trying to sneak through a guardpost, citadel,
      or city where they can't afford to be recognized, one of the
      characters' old friends recognizes him and loudly renews their
      acquaintance in full view of the guards looking for the
      characters. This usually leads to an exciting chase as the heroes
      must escape.
4. Seducer - One of the characters is invited to a romantic liaison with an
      attractive local. This local can just be interested in a brief
      tryst, could fall madly in love with the hero and follow the hero
      through the rest of the adventure, could be a Loving Deceiver
      monster encounter, could be a thief and rob the hero blind, or
      could be a spy or assassin working for the Master Villain.
5. Inquisitive Official - Some local authority has noticed the characters' presence and it
      makes her curious. She snoops around asking questions all the
      time. She may be a city guardsman or special agent of the ruler,
      but (functionally) she's a police lieutenant, asking the rong
      questions at the wrong time; the heroes have to work around her,
      sneaking where normally they'd be able to work in the open.
6. Thief - At some point in their adventure, the heroes have a run-in with
      thieves.
7. New Enemy - In the course of his ordinary activies, one of the heroes can
      make a New Enemy. Hurrying along the street, he can bump into a
      disagreeable fighter for whom an apology isn't enough; in a
      tavern, he can make some innocuous remark that you deliberately
      have the irritable fellow misconstrue as an insult. The New Enemy
      will only exchange heated words with the hero at this point, but
      will appear again later in the adventure and will eventually have
      to fight the hero.
8. Truthful Accuser - This encounter is like the Lying Accuser except that the accuser
      is telling the truth. Dig through your characters' pasts, uncover
      a misdeed or two, and, when the heroes are at a critical point in
      their adventure, confront them with someone they actually have
      wronged. This person has found them and appealed to sympathetic
      local authorities. The heroes will have to make good or have the
      authorities on their backs for some time to come.
9. Bureaucrat - Some time in their adventure, the heroes must deal with the local
      government and run into that most horrible of nuisance monsters,
      the bureaucrat and his red-tape dispenser. The heroes don't have
      the right forms. When they have the right forms, they forgot to
      fill them out in triplicate. And so on.
10. Lying Accuser - A captured thief may accuse the character of putting him up to
      the theft; an abandoned mother may accuse the hero of fathering
      the child; a reputable witness (working for the Master Villain)
      may accuse the hero of a murder or robbery. The hero shouldn't
      know what he's accused of until he's hauled in by the
      authorities.
11. Mean Drunk - The Mean Drunk works much like the Belligerent Soldier except
      that he's not as tough, is of course drunk, and is usually
      accompanied by other Mean Drunks.
12. Bandit Gang - When the heroes are en route from one place to another, have them
      run across one of the local bandit gangs. The bandits are faster
      and far more numerous than the heroes. But the bandits stay back.
      Basically, they're bandits who admire courage and prowess, and
      the bandit leader will challenge one or all of the heroes to a
      test of bravery or ability -- such as a horserace, a duel, a
      wrestling match, a joust, an arm-wrestling match where scorpions
      sting the loser, etc.
13. Press Gang - In any port city, the heroes, in a tavern or hostel, may find
      themselves set upon by ruffians employed by the city; these
      ruffians use clubs and strike to subdue. If the heroes fight and
      beat the ruffians, they find themselves wanted by the law for
      assaulting officers of the peace. And if they fight and lose,
      they wake up to find themselves sailors, headed far away from
      their quest! Now they must decide whether they're going to jump
      ship, mutiny, or just settle down toa few years of seafaring
      life.

==============================
===== Deathtrap
==============================
1. Pit and the Pendulum - Actually, we're applying this term to any of many time-delay
      deathtraps. In this sort of trap, the villains capture the heroes
      and place them in a trap which will soon kill them -- it operates
      on a delay, often based on a timing device or a burning fuse.
2. Rock and a Hard Place - This trap starts out as an Animal Pit, Pit and the Pendulum, or
      Tomb Deathtrap, but an obvious escape suggests itself very early
      on. Trouble is, it leads into even worse danger. The hole out of
      the animal pit may lead to the lair of an even worse animal; it
      may lead through a succession of dangers (collapsing old
      catacombs, into an underground river, into a den of zombies)
      before the heroes reach the light.
3. Stampede - Should the heroes ever cross plains or prairies, their villainous
      enemies may wish to stampede a herd of large animals at them.
      Alternatively, beasts in the forest may be stampeded by fires set
      by the villains; in this case, it will not be one sort of animal
      charging through, but a mixture of terrified forest animals, from
      the smallest fox-cub to the largest bear.
4. Mutually Assured Destruction - In this very nasty deathtrap, the heroes are bound up in such a
      manner that any one of them may get free of his bonds -- but when
      he does, all his friends perish. Obviously, the heroes' task is
      to find some way for everyone to get out alive. Perhaps an
      intricate series of cooperative rope-cutting will defuse the
      trap; perhaps a coordinated maneuver will get everyone free as
      the trap is being sprung.
5. Demolition Zone - In this classic deathtrap, the heroes are placed (usually bound
      and weaponless) in some building or area just as it's due to be
      destroyed.
6. Animal Pit - This is a classic trap of the adventure genre: The heroes
      (perhaps just one hero) are dropped into a pit filled with
      dangerous animals -- snakes, lions, bears, whatever. They must
      either fight the beasts or delay them until they can escape --
      climb back out, open a secret door, break down a wall, have a
      rope lowered by friends above, etc.
7. Tomb Deathtraps - Another classic type of trap is the sort of triggered trap left
      behind in abandoned tombs, ruins, and catacombs. Here, a hero who
      touches the wrong step, floor tile, wall brick, torch bracket,
      mounted gemstone, or other device will trigger some sort of
      ancient trap designed to kill tomb-robbers and intruders.
8. Framed - One or more of the heroes is accused and convicted of a capital
      crime -- one for which the mandatory punishment is death. The
      heroes must escape or die, and they're escaping from the
      well-built, well-protected prison of the local authorities.
9. Coliseum - If it's appropriate, you can have the heroes captured by the
      local authorities -- particularly when they're in an exotic land,
      lost world, or whatever -- and have them armed with gladiatorial
      gear and dropped into a coliseum for the entertainment of the
      locals. (Note that this works much better with fighting-type
      heroes than spellcasters.)
10. Avalanche - This is an outdoors trap. Some time when the heroes are in a
      narrow canyon or gorge, or are on a snow-covered mountain, their
      enemies can arrange to dump an avalanche upon them (rocks and
      boulders in the first instance, snow in the second).

==============================
===== Chase
==============================
1. Footrace - The chase involves the characters on foot, probably through such
      terrain as city streets or the corridors of a palace. One hero
      may realize that the's being pursued by a party of enemies and
      choose to run for it; the heroes may have caught up to the Master
      Villain, prompting him to run for his life.
2. Horseback - This is a relatively short chase -- it only needs to go on for a
      mile or so before even the best horses are winded. If it goes on
      longer than that, the horses may collapse and perhaps die.
3. Special Terrain - You can make any chase more memorable by having it take place in
      a setting to which it is utterly unsuited. For instance, horse
      chases are fine and dramatic when they take place through the
      forest, out in the open plains, or along a road -- but they
      become diabolical when they take place inside the Royal Palace or
      in dangerous, labrynthine, treacherous catacombs.
4. Endurance - The Endurance Chase is not some sort of climactic chase -- it's a
      rugged, tiring, persistent pursuit that tests the characters to
      their limits. In this chase, the heroes and villains are pursuing
      one another across a lot of territory and they're not catching up
      with one another very fast. This may be a horseback pursuit
      across a hundred miles of savannah, a camel chase across several
      days' worth of desert, or a chase across arctic tundra.
5. Aerial - The heroes could be riding pegasi or friendly griffons or allied
      great eagles; the villains could be carried aloft by gargoyles or
      demons. The prospect of taking a mile-long fall if one's mount is
      hit is a very daunting and challenging one for the hero.
6. Water - Don't forget the water chase: Whether it's a battle of seamanship
      between naval vessels, a chase of rafts toward the inevitable
      waterfall ahead, a contest of canoeing ability, or a chase
      between the villain and his giant shark vs. the heroes and their
      dolphin friends, the water chase can be a distinctive and
      dramatic one.

==============================
===== Omen/Prophesy
==============================
1. Reincarnation - The hero, seeing the portrait of some long-dead nobleman, may be
      surprised to see his own face staring back at him. All evidence
      points to the fact that our hero is the reincarnation of this
      person, and the Master Villain may desire to destroy any trace of
      that nobleman's existence. Just as appropriately, this long-dead
      nobleman may have died after making some important choice -- such
      as choosing love over career or career over friends; and the
      choice he faced is identical to the one the hero now faces. Will
      our hero defy the prophecy and choose as he did in a previous
      life, or will he choose the other option and see what happens?
2. Innocent Fulfills Prophecy - An innocent could fulfill a prophecy -- one which endangers
      his/her life. This innocent might, for instance, be the one who
      is supposed to slay the king, but is not a mighty adventurer able
      to protect himself from the king; the heroes may find themselves
      sheltering and helping this poor dupe.
3. Totem Animal - If a hero has an animal which is his totem, he may see the animal
      engaged in a fight to the death with another animal -- one which,
      coincidentally, is the totem of one of the villains. How his
      totem defeats the other -- or is defeated by it -- gives the hero
      some clues as how to fight his actual opponent when the time
      comes.
4. Birthmark - One of the heroes has a birthmark that pertains to the adventure
      in some way. He may have a birthmark identical to some NPC -- for
      instance, some person endangered by the Master Villain. This
      mystery can give the hero his reason to become involved.
      Alternatively, his birthmark may mark him as a hero fulfilling
      some ancient prophecy.
5. Hero Fulfills Prophecy - This is the most useful sort of prophecy. In the early part of
      the adventure, one of the heroes discovers that he fulfills some
      ancient prophecy.
6. Comet's Progress - Events during the adventure may be enlivened by a large and
      menacing comet which appears in the night sky for several days
      during the scenario; the locals take it for an omen of doom. The
      comet may be the result of magic being used by the Master
      Villain, or the comet's appearance can pertain to an old legend
      involving the Master Villain.
7. Fortune Teller Predicts Doom - This is an ominous encounter: A fortune-teller predicts doom for
      one of the heroes, or for some community menaced by the Master
      Villain. Shortly after, some calamity should befall the hero: He
      can be attacked by an assassin, be in a building when it is
      struck by fire or an earthquake, or suffer other danger.
      Investigation of the events can then point the heroes toward the
      Master Villain as the event's instigator.

==============================
===== Secret Weakness
==============================
1. Holy Symbol - The villain may have the traditional weakness to a specific holy
      symbol -- but don't choose just an ordinary one. It may be a
      holly symbol no longer used by the church, or may be some
      forgotten variation of the current symbol. (For instance, the
      cross may not work, but a variation -- such as the Roman cross --
      might; alternatively, it might have to be a holy symbol which has
      undergone some unfamiliar ritual.)
2. Love - The Master Villain possesses the "weakness" of genuine affection
      or love -- probably for some NPC, though it could be very
      intriguing if the object of his affections is a player-character.
      The heroes can then defeat the villain by holding his loved one
      hostage, or proving that his loved one will be seriously harmed,
      betrayed, or killed if the villain keeps up with his activity.
3. Element - The Master Villain can be banished, dispelled, killed, or
      otherwise defeated by some of element or item. The Master Villain
      tries to get rid of all the examples of this element in his
      vicinity; he doesn't let his minions carry it or bring it into
      his presence. But he's not stupid; he doesn't announce to the
      world what his weakness is. He tries to hide his concern within
      another command. If he's allergic to red roses, for instance, he
      orders all "things of beauty" destroyed within miles of his
      abode.
4. Lack of Familiarity - The Master Villain, if he comes from the past or another
      dimension, or belongs to an alien race, might be sufficiently
      unfamiliar with this world that he essentially defeats himself.
      How? By making incorrect guesses about human behaviour. One
      classic error involves underestimating the human capacity for
      self-sacrifice.
5. Secret Embarrassment - Finally, the villain may have some aberration or secret shame
      that will force him to flee when he is confronted with it. It
      could be something as simple as the fact that his nose is too
      big, or that he is a small and nebbishly wizard pretending to be
      some vast, powerful demonic power. When his shame is revealed, he
      is too humiliated to continue; this is a good option for comedy
      adventures.

==============================
===== Special Condition
==============================
1. Coping with a Curse - The curse might be making the hero progressively uglier, might be
      draining out his life-force (he's losing experience which will be
      retruned if he succeeds), or might be making him progressively
      insane. Each day, as he sees his reflection in a mirror or pond
      or fountain, he'll know himself to be less than he used to be.
2. Time Limit - Finally, the most obvious condition to place on an adventure is
      to give it a time limit. If the Master Villain is going to
      conclude his evil spell in only three days, and his citadel is
      three hard days' riding away, then the heroes are going to be on
      the go all throughout the adventure -- with little time to rest,
      plan, gather allies, or anything except get to where they're
      going.
3. Stolen Identities - This option requires that the Master Villain be of godlike power
      oor possess some sort of artifact. Once the Master Villain
      realizes that the heroes are on his tail, he uses his powers or
      artifact and steals the heroes' identities. One day they wake up
      -- and no one knows who they are. They retain their memories of
      themselves and each other, but no one else does. (The villain
      knows them, though.)
4. No Lawbreaking - For some reason, at one point in the story, the heroes cannot
      allow themselves to break the law -- even when it would help them
      greatly to do so. For instance, the heroes may be asking for the
      help of a king whose word is law and whose power is immense. When
      they arrive for their audience, an emissary of the Master Villain
      is making a similar plea for help. If the heroes attack and kill
      that emissary, they will lose any chance at the king's help -- in
      fact, he may order their execution.
5. Omnipresent Observer - If a wizard, demigod or god has forced the heroes to undertake
      this quest, he may be with them continually -- in spirit. He
      can't help them, but does magically watch everything they do. And
      when they do something he doesn't like, he tells them about it --
      loudly and nastily. (This is distressing when they're trying to
      break into a fortress or sneak through enemy lines.)
6. No Hurting the Villain - For some reason, the heroes cannot afford to fight the villain
      directly. For instance, what if a demon possesses the body of the
      child of one of the characters, or a very important child spoken
      of in prophecy, one without whom the world will perish?
7. No Weapons Allowed - At some point in the story, the heroes must surrender their
      weapons. Perhaps they're visiting some quarter of the city where
      weapons are not allowed; or a particularly peace-loving temple.
      In any case, once they're there, they are attacked by enemies
      belonging to the Master Villain.
8. Magic Doesn't Work Right - If the adventure is taking place on an alternate plane, then that
      plane's magic works oddly or not at all. (A spellcaster will find
      that just making himself useful is a challenge when none of his
      spells works.)

==============================
===== Moral Quandry
==============================
1. Honor Quandry - You want to use this on the character with the most strongly
      developed sense of personal honor -- someone who has lived all
      his life by a strict code. Toward the end of the adventure, this
      character realizes that the best way to defeat the Master Villain
      is a violation of that code. For instance, the character might be
      a paladin, who discovers that the only possible way for the
      heroes to defeat the Master Villain is to sneak up on him and
      stab him in the back.
2. Ally Quandry - You set up the situation so that the heroes have a good chance at
      defeating the Master Villain if they get the aid of two specific
      individuals, probably experts in fields relating to the villains'
      activities. But the two experts hate one another and refuse to
      work together, even if it costs them their world.
3. Saving Quandry - Finally, another classic quandry puts the heroes in the position
      of choosing between a grand opportunity to hurt the Master
      Villain -- or saving the lives of a number of individuals.
4. Respect Quandry - This is much like the Ally Quandry, only at a greater distance.
      The heroes have been utilizing the aid of two (or more) powerful
      NPC allies. Now, in the course of the adventure, the heroes come
      across a task which can be accomplished in one of two ways --
      say, through military intervention or by esoteric magic. The
      problem is, the NPC allies are arguing for different choices, and
      the one whom the heores choose against will no longer aid them.
5. Friend Quandry - At a critical point in the story, one of the campaign's NPCs
      makes an impossible demand of one of the heroes.

==============================
===== Red Herring
==============================
1. False Path to the Artifact - Once again, if the heroes have had too easy a time finding the
      artifact capable of destroying the villain, give them trouble
      this way: When they get to the place where the artifact is
      supposed to be contained, they find the coffer or chamber or
      whatever empty, obviously looted by robbers, who have scrawled
      such remarks as "Kelrog was here!" upon the walls.
2. Artifact that Doesn't Work - Often, epic quests against powerful Master Villains require that
      the heroes find some legendary artifact, the only object which
      can defeat the villain. If your heroes have had no trouble
      getting to the artifact -- they've effortlessly sliced through
      every obstacle you've put in their path and are confidently
      advancing on the resting place of the magical item -- you can
      have it not work.
3. Lying Rumor - This is the worst and most useful type of red herring -- the
      interesting rumor which just happens to be false. In adventures
      of this sort, the best Lying Rumor concerns the Master Villain;
      it gives the heroes some "important" information about him which
      later turns out to be useless.
4. Loony who Has It Wrong - You can have the heroes "aided" by a so-called expert who is
      actually a lunatic who doesn't know anything about what he's
      talking about. Once he's led the heroes off to some remote part
      of the continent, his evasive answers and bizarre behaviour will
      alert them that he really doesn't know anything about what he's
      pretended to be an expert on.
5. Extraneous Details - When giving the heroes details on their enemy -- for instance,
      details they are learning from investigations and readings -- you
      can give them just a few details too many. This may prompt the
      heroes to investigate the "extra" (i.e., irrelevant) details in
      addition to the relevant onces, thus losing them valuable time.

==============================
===== Cruel Trick
==============================
1. Villain Accompanies Party - In this distressing situation, the Master Villain, in disguise or
      his secret identity, accompanies the heroes for much of their
      quest. He gets to know them, learns their strengths and
      weaknesses, learns their plans, and just as soon as it's most
      efficient for him, he thwarts their current plans and leaves.
      Alternatively, the Master Villain might be with the heroes all
      along, up to the very end; the heroes know that one of their
      companions is the villain, and the whole thrust of the story is
      finding out who he is. This is the whole purpose of most
      Mystery-type adventures.
2. Heroes Must Work with Villain - If they have to work for the villain, it's due to some hold he
      has over them -- probably, he's kidnapped one of their NPCs and
      will kill this person if his demands aren't met. Put the heroes
      through the encounter where they have to do something they are
      loathe to do, such as sack and pillage a temple, before they have
      the opportunity to retrieve their friend.
3. Wanted by the Law - One final complication, one which occurs pretty frequently, is
      when the heroes are wanted by the law. When they're wanted by the
      law, they have to travel in secret and very limited in the
      resources they can acquire.
4. NPC Turns Traitor - He may alert he enemy when the heroes are planning a raid; he may
      steal the artifact and take it to the villain; he may stab a hero
      or important NPC in the back (literally) before departing.
5. Villain is Related to Hero - In this very irritating complication, one of the heroes discovers
      that the Master Villain is related to him. The villain might be
      his long-lost father or twin; perhaps this relative is not
      long-lost after all, but has secretly been a Master Villain for
      years, and only now has the hero discovered it.
6. Mission is a Ruse - In the course of their adventuring, the heroes discover they have
      been tricked into performing a mission which helps the Master
      Villain.
