1) A charismatic peasant has been making some noise in the city slums talking about rights, freedom and other unsavory topics. The spies couldn't find nothing on her and the emperor doesn't want a martyr. Can the players stop the brewing revolution and if so, how? Surely she must have a price... right?
2) The players have to escort a quiet teenager to another city. Who is this person? Why were the players personally asked by the emperor to deal with this trivial matter? The roads are safe, it's not like there is going to be an ambush. What's going on? Now that they think about it, he looks a bit like the emperor...
3) It finally had to happen. That goddamn hero foretold by the typical old prophecies banned by the empire. Everything checks out: humble origins, magical sword, cute pet as comedic relief... and so good-looking! Of course the emperor is not an idiot and sents the elite team (the players) right away to deal with the hero. Unfortunately the Fates seem to be on their side and not on the player's so "just kill him!" isn't going to cut it.
4) "Person A has a package he wants to deliver to Person B.
Person B is not inside his home at the moment. You get the option to put the package in his mail slot.
When you return to Person A, person A is gone. An explosion is heard from Person Bs house.
