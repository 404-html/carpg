FEATURE:
3. dungeon mesh vb, ib
? test uv texture
+ textures
+ each room have polygons to draw info
+ lights, normal mapping
-? don't add doors overhang wall ?
+ remove old scene.cpp code
4. ramps physics
validate options in DungeonGenerator::Generate
moving player
? GenerateDungeonObjects2 - spawning door fragments near corridor/door rooms (FindPath/SetupCamera uses this too)
5. navmesh
+ pathfinding room -> tile -> minitile
6. positioning
+ each room with random y
	+ floor/ceil physics
	+ camera collide with floor/ceil
	+ bullets collide with floor/ceil
	+ enemy shoot/magic
	- spawn wolf - floor is colliding
	? low ceil heigh phy
	- warp area invalid pos
	- stairs down invalid unit pos
+ ramps, good y
	? how to store y?
	+ units
	+ items
	+ blood
	+ physics
	+ colliders
	+ prevent spawning traps on ramps
+ save/load/compability
	+ BLOKADA_SCIANA removed
	+ RoomTarget changed
	+ resize level so rooms are not on border
	+ Room flags
+ gray dots on minimap when there is doors
! FIXME
? labirynth, cave, tutorial
	- lab uses old room size
? old saves
===============================================================================================================
NEW:
2. ramp, small step
3. test jumping (no animation)
4. big step - animation phy moving (require jump key)
5. very big step - longer anim (jump grab)
6. hitting ceil with head - small corridor (same room)
7. deep hole - R to restart position
8. overhangs - move under, jump grab
9b. draw debug phy
10. create navmesh
10b. draw navmesh
11. draw path to player (Key - mark start pos, Key - change allow fall or not)


x. rooms pathfinding

feature requirements:
0. falling to lower level - navmesh -> allow fall
1. holes - navmesh -> don't fall
2. climb over small objects - detect step_size and use animation
3. climp over big objects (jump) - like above but different animation
5***. ropes
7. fall damage

+ don't recreate dungeon physics/mesh when loading same level
+ tower stairs should be rotated clock-wise to help defend for right handed
+ stairs physics collider
+ use D3DPOOL_DEFAULT and rebuild dungeon mesh

- map2console mine uses Pole::ZAJETE which is not in array
